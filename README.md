# Decimer-Python
Deep Learning for Chemical Image Recognition (DECIMER) - Python scripts

This project hosts the tools and networks written in python which aims to develop methods to employ deep learning to recognize and interpret chemical structure from images in the printed and online literature with the aim of re-discovering scientific facts about natural products and their meta-data. 

The project is co-supervised by Prof. Christoph Steinbeck, Jena, and Prof. Achim Zielesny, Westphalian University of Applied Sciences, Recklinghausen.
